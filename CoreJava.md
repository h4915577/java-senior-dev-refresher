6) Differece between Comparable and Comparator along with compare and compareTo.

How will you test a method that will throw exception and how will you assert its msg using junit 5 (use: assertThrows() method)

Java immutability - write a sample class and ensure fields are not modified from the outside
Design an Immutable class, a variation was also asked like if a List<String> was

how to make sure that even this list is immutable in this class(suggest a method other than
Collections.immutableList)
