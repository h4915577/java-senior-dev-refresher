1. Need to understand when to use what design pattern.. Scenario might be given to assess what design pattern to use. For example - if you have been asked to implement the following method "public List<Flight> sortFlightsByCriteria(String criteria)" considering that criteria can be sort by time or distance, the approach should be used to deploy strategy design pattern. After that the interviewer would expect you to write the code for it. Practicing dry run for the use case would come in handy.

2. More often than not, you would be asked to come up with a use case where you have employed the design pattern. If you cant find it, you should try to put the relevant prompts in perplexity.ai or claud and come up with a credible answer. For many of the panelists, it comes as a red flag if you are not able to spot one or suggest one.

3. Common Design Patterns - Strategy, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Adapter, Proxy,Delegate
