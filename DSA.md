1. Breadth First Search - Data Structure to implement it (Queue)
2. Depth First Search - Data Structure to implement it (Stack)
3. HashMap - Internals, Why HashMap is able to achive O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations ? In what scenario do you think the time complexity would decrease to O(n) time complexity ? What improvements have been done in java8 to fix this ? What is loadFactor in HashMap and how it is used ?
4. LinkedHashMap - use case where we can use it. Example - LRU Cache
5. Internal Implementation of TreeMap - RedBlackTree. Understand at high level how red black tree corresponds to balanced binary search tree
6. What is binary search tree ? What would be the time complexity of searching an element in binary serach Tree ?
7. ConcurrentHashMap - where would you use it ? Able to explain internal implementation
8. HashMap vs HashTable
9. LinkedHashMap - use where we can use it
10. Synchronized HashMap vs Concurrent HashMap ?
11. What happen if we add duplicate key, value records into concurrent HashMap ?
12. Binary Search Questions Can be tricky. Need to see how to use it. Example usage - Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-and-last-positions-of-an-element-in-a-sorted-array/
13. Question on equals() and hashcode() contract
Can we override only hashcode and if yes then what will be the effect
14. BinaryTree - InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder traversals
